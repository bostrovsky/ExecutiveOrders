# ExecutiveOrders

Uses the presidentData dataset which the author created by combining 3 datasets downloaded from
www.data.gov and minimally processing them.  The datasets are a listing of all executive orders 
issued by each of the last 3 presidents (Clinton, Bush & Obama).  The original datasets can be 
downloaded from:

1. Bush: http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/executive-orders-george-w-bush
2. Clinton: http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/executive-orders-william-j-clinton
3. Obama: http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/executive-orders-barack-obama

The user can choose which president to review and see how many executive orders by year that presedent signed.  They may also chose "All 3" to see the whole 23 year span (up thorugh mid-March 2015).
